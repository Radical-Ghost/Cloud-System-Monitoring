# ☁️ Cloud System Monitor (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
**GitHub Repository:** [Radical-Ghost/Cloud-System-Monitoring](https://github.com/Radical-Ghost/Cloud-System-Monitoring)

A complete DevOps pipeline deploying a containerized system monitoring dashboard to Oracle Cloud (OCI). It tracks real-time CPU, GPU, Memory, Disk, and running processes. Built with **Python Flask**, containerized with **Docker**, secured with **Trivy**, and deployed via **Terraform** and **GitHub Actions/Jenkins** CI/CD pipelines.

## 🏗️ Cloud Infrastructure (Terraform)

The `terraform/` directory contains complete Infrastructure-as-Code to deploy this application to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Always Free tier.

### Infrastructure Provisioned Automatically:

-   **Networking:** Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) (`10.0.0.0/16`) and Public Subnet.
-   **Firewall (Security List):** Restricts ingress to Port 22 (SSH) and Port 5000 (Flask Dashboard) only.
-   **Compute Instance:** Oracle Linux 8 `VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro` instance.
-   **Provisioning Script:** The instance user-data automatically installs Docker and configuring firewall rules on first boot.

### Deploying the Infrastructure:

Ensure you have OCI credentials inserted into your `terraform.tfvars` file, then initialize and deploy:

```bash
cd terraformterraform initterraform planterraform apply --auto-approve
```

Upon successful deployment, Terraform will output the `instance_public_ip` which is required to access the dashboard.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines Automated Deployment

This project utilizes automated CI/CD pipelines to build the Docker image, run security scans, and deploy the application to the Oracle Cloud compute instance.

### GitHub Actions (Primary Pipeline)

The `.github/workflows/main.yml` file is triggered on every push to the repository. The workflow executes the following architecture:

1.  **Source Checkout:** Pulls the latest repository code.
2.  **Docker Build:** Compiles the continuous integration container.
3.  **Trivy Security Scan:** Scans the Docker image for HIGH and CRITICAL CVE vulnerabilities, outputting a JSON report artifact.

### Jenkins Integration

A complete `Jenkinsfile` is also provided to achieve the exact same 6-stage operational pipeline locally in Jenkins (Build → Scan → Terraform Init → Terraform Apply → Deploy via SSH/SCP).

## 🔒 Security Posture & Vulnerability Remediation

### Implemented Best Practices

| Practice | Implementation Strategy |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Secrets Management | Credentials abstracted to ignored `terraform.tfvars` / Pipeline Secrets |
| Privilege Escalation | Dockerfile enforces a non-root `appuser` |
| Image Footprint | Uses `python:3.11-slim` with multi-stage builds |
| Firewall Constraint | Native OCI Security Lists (`main.tf`) drop all unauthorized traffic |
| Container Health | Native Docker `HEALTHCHECK` directive |
| Automated Scanning | AquaSecurity Trivy integrated blocking CI/CD |

### Vulnerability Remediation Log

| # | Vulnerability Identified | Severity | Remediation Solution |
|---|--------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Container running as root | HIGH | Built non-root `appuser` within the Docker build process |
| 2 | Bloated base image dependencies | MEDIUM | Refactored `Dockerfile` to use `3.11-slim` |
| 3 | Hardcoded deployment credentials | HIGH | Terminated risk by moving vars to `.tfvars` |
| 4 | Open 0.0.0.0 SSH firewall | MEDIUM | Enforced `allowed_ssh_cidr` terraform constraint |
| 5 | Unscanned vulnerabilities deployed | HIGH | Deployed Trivy hard-blocking the execution pipeline |

## 🤖 AI Usage Report

Generative AI was utilized to accelerate the development lifecycle and augment security best practices.

**Usage Summary:**

1.  **Infrastructure as Code:** Assisted with learning and compiling the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure syntax for the `terraform/` configurations (VCNs, Subnets).
2.  **Containerization:** Helped optimize the `Dockerfile` by suggesting multi-stage builds and non-root execution practices (`appuser`).
3.  **CI/CD Automation:** Provided boilerplate syntax to structure the multi-stage `Jenkinsfile` and GitHub Actions `.yml` pipelines.
